## Analysis of NYC MTA Daily Activities:

I analyze both of daily Entries and Exits data as Daily Activities for ploting the following charts:

### Chart 1 tells us:
  1. Each line with different colors represents one week of riderships from the first week of March to the mid of May (total 11 weeks) at 59 ST station.
  2. Riderships double down on Saturdays and almost triple down on Sundays.
  3. Weekdays are much more passengers than weekends, so we'd recommend our client to place their street stands on weekdays only.

### Chart 2 tells us:
  1. Top 3 stations that had the highest foot traffic during March to May 2021 are 34 ST Penn Station, 86 ST and 125 ST.
  2. From the ranking # 2 to # 4 (34 ST Herald Sq) stations have roughly the same amounts of daily activites, and the #5 (23 ST) and #6 (14 ST Union Sq) are about the same. 
  3. As the next step is to filter out some stations which are out-of-range of major Tech offices area, this Top 15 stations list can help me to cut down from 15 to only 10 or less target stations to provide for our client's need.
